# AI Chat Application

This is a simple AI chat application that utilises Wit.ai for natural language processing to understand user input, allowing users to interact with the AI through the text box input.

This model is based on 1 x Q&A with changeable input and a keyword-based natural language processing model to understand user input and return a corresponding response via Wit.AI.

The app responds to greetings and provides a voice response feature, making the interaction engaging and user-friendly.
